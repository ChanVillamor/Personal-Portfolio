        heading: '1. Back-End Fundamentals & Logic',
        description:
          "One of the toughest parts was grasping the logic side of back-end development. Understanding how routes, controllers, and database queries connect felt confusing at first. It wasn‚Äôt just syntax‚ÄîI struggled more with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the code."
      },
      {
        heading: '2. Layout and Responsiveness Across Breakpoints',
        description:
          "Making layouts work smoothly across all screen sizes took trial and error. While Tailwind CSS made things easier, aligning elements and maintaining visual consistency across breakpoints wasn‚Äôt as simple as it looked. It took repeated testing and restructuring to make everything responsive and accessible."
      },
      {
        heading: '3. Time & Task Management (Self-Study)',
        description:
          "Managing time efficiently while juggling academic requirements and self-study was a real challenge. There were days where I‚Äôd feel productive, and others where motivation was low or I had no clear direction‚Äîespecially when switching between coding, design, and documentation tasks."
      },
      {
        heading: '4. Impostor Syndrome',
        description:
          "Seeing others‚Äô polished work online often made me second-guess myself. I‚Äôd ask if I was doing enough or learning fast enough. Even when I was progressing, it was hard not to feel like I was falling behind."
      },
      {
        heading: '5. Information Overload',
        description:
          "There are so many resources online that I didn‚Äôt always know where to start. I‚Äôd jump from one tutorial to the next, trying to find the ‚Äúbest‚Äù way to learn, which only made things more overwhelming and slowed down my momentum."

        heading: 'Breaking Down the Backend',
        description:
          "I stopped trying to learn everything at once. I focused on small projects and real-world examples to understand Laravel logic and database interactions better. Step-by-step, it started making more sense."
      },
      {
        heading: 'Responsive Design',
        description:
          "Cloning websites and testing layouts on different devices helped me master Tailwind‚Äôs breakpoint system. I learned to design mobile-first and prioritize user experience on all screen sizes."
      },
      {
        heading: 'Structured Self-Study',
        description:
          "I started planning weekly goals and using tools like notes or google tasks to track what I was working on. Even on slow days, seeing a checklist helped me stay consistent and focused."
      },
      {
        heading: 'Managing Self-Doubt',
        description:
          "I learned to compare less and reflect more. Instead of measuring progress against others, I began looking at how far I‚Äôd come. Small wins‚Äîlike fixing bugs or completing a new section‚Äîbecame proof of growth."
      },
      {
        heading: 'Filtering Resources',
        description:
          "I began curating and sticking to specific learning paths. Instead of bouncing between tutorials, I have a personal reference library of tools, cheat sheets, and resources that actually helped me move forward."

    title: '‚ú® Self-Reflection',
    content: [
      {
        heading: '',
        description:
          "This experience reminded me that growth isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about persistence. Every challenge became a stepping stone toward understanding, confidence, and resilience. I‚Äôve learned to trust my process, take breaks when needed, and always come back with curiosity. The journey hasn‚Äôt been perfect, but it‚Äôs been real‚Äîand I‚Äôm proud of how much I‚Äôve grown, not just as a developer, but as a learner."
